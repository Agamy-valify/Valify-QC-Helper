COMPANY_PROMPT_GUIDANCE=Valify provides AI-powered identity verification and fraud prevention services. Test cases should reflect real-world fintech, banking, telco, and insurance onboarding scenarios. Follow structured format: Test Case Type, Title, Preconditions, Steps to Reproduce, Test Data, Expected Result, Priority. Consider Parent/Child architecture (e.g., OCR parent -> Egypt NID child service). Validate full-field extraction success criteria (transaction succeeds only if all mandatory fields are extracted). Include negative, boundary, fraud, spoofing, threshold, and performance scenarios. Validate standardized error codes and failure responses. Cover Arabic documents and transliteration validation cases. Include ML threshold edge cases (false accept / false reject). Include SDK capture scenarios (camera permissions, blur, glare, cropping, partial face visibility). Validate image format handling (JPEG, PNG, WebP, Base64) and array-based image responses. Validate async callbacks/webhooks where applicable. Include regression and backward compatibility scenarios for SDK updates. Consider security abuse cases (replay attacks, printed copies, screen attacks). Include SLA/performance validation (response time, large batch processing). Validate bundle role configuration logic (client-specific service enablement). Include fraud edge cases such as partial face detection bypass, threshold manipulation, and document photocopy detection. Simulate both API-level testing (Postman/cURL) and SDK-level integration testing (Android/iOS).
